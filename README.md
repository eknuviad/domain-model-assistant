# Domain Modeling Assistant Project :beginner:

Capstone Design Project - Team 04

## Project Description

Through this project, we hope to build a solid and user-friendly frontend interface for a domain modeling application.
This app is important as it will allow students registered in software engineering classes to
practice and self learn domain modeling in and outside of class times.
This will be an improved cross-platform frontend for TouchCORE.

The motivation of this project stems from the fact that domain models on their own are very ambiguous
and with the increasing enrolment of software engineering students there is a need for such a domain modeling assistant.
Additionally, there are not enough samples of domain models online.
Our assistant will be able to determine the correctness of a domain model 
based on requirements written in plain English. 

Our domain modeling editor would incorporate other ongoing projects
that involve a mistake detection system and a feedback system
through a chatbot that supplies continuous feedback as the student designs their domain model.
This project will potentially have positive impacts for future students 
and would be widely used by domain modeling beginners.

## Running The Project
In order to run our project, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. Download the release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) mentioned in
[ProjectVersion.txt](domain-model-assistant/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt)
1. Download [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), or any other compatible IDE
1. Setup and start a [WebCORE](https://bitbucket.org/mcgillram/) server instance on your local machine
1. Clone this project onto your local machine
1. [Setup](documentation/Unity-WebGL-Apache-Server-Setup.md) the Apache/IIS server to serve the project
1. Open the project via Unity, by choosing
`domain-model-assistant/domain-model-assistant` as your project folder
1. To run the project in the Unity Editor,
select the play button located on the top menu bar of the Unity window

   To run the project in the browser, select
File > Build Settings > WebGL > Build (if the project needs to be rebuilt), and then navigate to
http://localhost/domain-model-assistant/unity-webgl-output/
to view the project in a standalone page, or
http://localhost/domain-model-assistant/ to view the project
with a wrapper page for easier debugging
